# Windows Loader 4.9.7: A Simple and Effective Way to Activate Windows 7, Server, Vista, XP
 
Windows Loader 4.9.7 is a small but powerful tool that can activate various versions of Windows operating systems, such as Windows 7, Server, Vista, XP, and more. It is developed by a team of hackers known as DAZ, who have also created other popular Windows activators, such as Windows Loader 3.1[^2^].
 
Windows Loader 4.9.7 works by bypassing Microsoft's Windows Activation Technologies (WAT), which are designed to prevent unauthorized use of Windows products. It does so by injecting a custom code into the system's boot sector, which then loads a modified version of the Windows license file. This way, Windows Loader 4.9.7 tricks Windows into thinking that it is genuine and activated.
