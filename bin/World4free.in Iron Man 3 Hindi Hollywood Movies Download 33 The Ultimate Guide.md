Iron Man 3 is one of the most successful films in the MCU, grossing over $1.2 billion worldwide. It received positive reviews from critics and audiences, who praised Downey's performance, the visual effects, the humor, and the action sequences. The film also won several awards, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects.
 
The film is set six months after the events of The Avengers (2012), in which Tony Stark and his fellow superheroes fought against an alien invasion led by Loki. Stark is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety attacks, and has become obsessed with building more Iron Man suits. He also struggles to balance his relationship with Pepper Potts, who is now the CEO of Stark Industries.
 
Meanwhile, a mysterious terrorist known as the Mandarin is orchestrating a series of bombings around the world, claiming to be a leader of a radical group called the Ten Rings. One of the bombings injures Stark's friend and former bodyguard Happy Hogan, prompting Stark to publicly challenge the Mandarin and reveal his home address. The Mandarin responds by sending helicopters to attack Stark's mansion, destroying it and leaving Stark presumed dead.
 
Stark survives and escapes in an experimental suit, but crash-lands in Tennessee. There, he meets a young boy named Harley Keener, who helps him repair his suit and investigate the origin of the bombings. He discovers that they are not caused by explosives, but by people infected with Extremis, a regenerative treatment developed by Stark's former colleague Maya Hansen and her boss Aldrich Killian. Killian is the founder of Advanced Idea Mechanics (AIM), a scientific research organization that has been secretly working with the Mandarin.
 
Stark realizes that the Mandarin is not a real person, but a British actor named Trevor Slattery, who was hired by Killian to play the role of a terrorist mastermind. Killian reveals that he is the true Mandarin, and that he plans to use Extremis to create an army of super-soldiers and overthrow the U.S. government. He also kidnaps Pepper and injects her with Extremis, intending to use her as leverage against Stark.
 
Stark teams up with Rhodes, who has been operating as the Iron Patriot under the orders of President Ellis. They infiltrate Killian's headquarters and rescue Pepper and Slattery, while also fighting off Killian's henchmen. Stark summons all his Iron Man suits to assist him in the battle, while Rhodes rescues the president from Killian's clutches. Pepper, who has survived Extremis and gained enhanced abilities, kills Killian by blasting him with a repulsor ray.
 
In the aftermath, Stark decides to undergo surgery to remove the shrapnel from his chest and destroy his arc reactor. He also destroys all his Iron Man suits as a sign of his devotion to Pepper. He declares that he will always be Iron Man, regardless of his suits. He also gives Harley a new garage and equipment as a thank you gift.
 
The film ends with a post-credits scene, in which it is revealed that Stark has been narrating his story to Bruce Banner / The Hulk, who fell asleep during the recount.
