## Step 1: Download Oracle 8i Software
 
The first step is to download the Oracle 8i software from the official Oracle website. You can find the download link here[^2^]. You will need to create an Oracle account or sign in with your existing one to access the download page. You will also need to accept the license agreement before downloading the software.
 
There are two packages that you need to download: the Basic package and the SQL\*Plus package. The Basic package contains all the files required to run OCI, OCCI, and JDBC-OCI applications. The SQL\*Plus package contains the SQL\*Plus command line tool for SQL and PL/SQL queries. You can choose either the Basic or the Basic Light package depending on your needs. The Basic Light package is smaller and has only English error messages and Unicode, ASCII, and Western European character set support.
 
The download files are in ZIP format and have names like instantclient-basic-nt-19.18.0.0.0dbru.zip and instantclient-sqlplus-nt-19.18.0.0.0dbru.zip. You can save them in any folder on your computer.
 
## Step 2: Install Oracle 8i Software
 
The second step is to install the Oracle 8i software on your Windows 7 32-bit computer. To do this, you need to extract the ZIP files that you downloaded in the previous step. You can use any file extraction tool such as WinZip or WinRAR to unzip the files.
 
After extracting the files, you will see two folders: instantclient\_19\_18 and instantclient\_19\_18\sqlplus. These folders contain the Oracle 8i software files that you need to install.

To install the software, you need to copy these folders to a location on your computer where you want to store the Oracle 8i software. For example, you can copy them to C:\oracle\instantclient\_19\_18.
 
Next, you need to set up some environment variables to make the software work properly. To do this, you need to open the Control Panel and click on System and Security. Then, click on System and select Advanced system settings from the left panel. This will open the System Properties window.
 
In the System Properties window, click on the Environment Variables button at the bottom. This will open another window where you can see and edit your environment variables.
 
In this window, you need to create or modify two environment variables: PATH and TNS\_ADMIN.
 
The PATH variable tells your computer where to look for executable files such as sqlplus.exe. To add the Oracle 8i software folders to your PATH variable, you need to select it from the list of system variables and click on Edit. Then, you need to append the following text at the end of the variable value:

    ;C:\oracle\instantclient_19_18;C:\oracle\instantclient_19_18\sqlplus

Make sure that there is a semicolon (;) before each folder path and that there are no spaces between them.
 
The TNS\_ADMIN variable tells your computer where to look for configuration files such as tnsnames.ora and sqlnet.ora. These files contain information about your database connection settings such as host name, port number, service name, etc. To create or modify your TNS\_ADMIN variable, you need to select it from the list of system variables or click
