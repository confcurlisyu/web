You will see a blank window where you can draw and edit your model.
 
## Drawing and Editing Your Model
 
To draw and edit your model in SAP2000 v7.42, you need to use the tools and commands available on the toolbar and the menu bar. You can also use keyboard shortcuts and mouse actions to perform various operations. Here are some of the basic tools and commands that you can use:

- The Draw menu allows you to draw different types of elements, such as joints, frames, cables, shells, areas, solids, links, hinges, supports, loads, etc.
- The Edit menu allows you to modify the properties and attributes of the elements, such as material, section, orientation, release, stiffness, mass, etc.
- The Select menu allows you to select one or more elements by using different criteria, such as type, label, group, layer, etc.
- The Assign menu allows you to assign different parameters and conditions to the elements, such as boundary conditions, load cases, load patterns, load combinations, design codes, etc.
- The Analyze menu allows you to perform different types of analysis on your model, such as linear static analysis, nonlinear static analysis, modal analysis, response spectrum analysis, time history analysis, etc.
- The Display menu allows you to view and manipulate the graphical representation of your model and the results of the analysis. You can also use the View menu to change the perspective and zoom level of your model.

You can also use the toolbar buttons to access some of the most frequently used tools and commands. For example, you can use the Snap button to enable or disable the snap mode that helps you align your elements with a grid or other elements. You can use the Undo and Redo buttons to undo or redo your last action. You can use the Run Analysis button to start or stop the analysis of your model. You can use the Show Tables button to view or edit the data tables that store the information about your model and the results of the analysis.

## Interpreting and Reporting Your Results
 
After you have performed an analysis on your model in SAP2000 v7.42, you can interpret and report your results by using the tools and commands available on the Display menu and the toolbar. Here are some of the basic tools and commands that you can use:

- The Deformed Shape command allows you to view the deformed shape of your model under different load cases or load combinations. You can also animate the deformed shape by using the Animate button on the toolbar.
- The Mode Shape command allows you to view the mode shape of your model under different modes of vibration. You can also animate the mode shape by using the Animate button on the toolbar.
- The Contour Plot command allows you to view a color-coded plot of different quantities on your model, such as displacements, forces, stresses, strains, etc. You can also change the scale and range of the plot by using the Scale button on the toolbar.
- The Diagram command allows you to view a graphical representation of different quantities along a selected element or path on your model, such as axial force diagram (AFD), shear force diagram (SFD), bending moment diagram (BMD), etc. You can also change the scale and range of the diagram by using the Scale button on the toolbar.
- The Table command allows you to view or edit a data table that contains different quantities for each element or joint on your model. You can also sort or filter the data table by using the Sort/Filter button on the toolbar.
- The Report command allows you to generate a report that summarizes your model information and analysis results in a printable format. You can also customize the content and layout of your report by using the Report Setup button 8cf37b1e13
