If you own a Huawei or Honor device with a Kirin processor and want to unlock its bootloader, you might have heard of PotatoNV. PotatoNV is an open-source tool that can generate bootloader unlock codes for several HiSilicon Kirin-powered Huawei and Honor devices. In this article, we will show you how to use PotatoNV to unlock the bootloader of your device.
 
## What is PotatoNV?
 
PotatoNV is a bootloader unlocker for select Huawei/Honor smartphones developed by Andrey Smirnoff. The tool makes use of a low-level bootloader flashing method discovered by XDA Senior Member hackintosh5. The tool requires users to open up the target device and access the test points on the motherboard.

What can I do after unlocking the bootloader?
<br>Unlocking the bootloader allows you to install custom ROMs, kernels, mods, root, etc. on your device. However, you should be careful about what you flash on your device as some files may be incompatible or harmful. Always make sure to download files from trusted sources and follow the instructions carefully. You should also backup your data before flashing anything on your device.<br>
<br>Some of the popular custom ROMs for Huawei and Honor devices are LineageOS, Pixel Experience, Resurrection Remix, etc. You can find them on [XDA Forums](https://forum.xda-developers.com/). To install a custom ROM, you need to have a custom recovery such as TWRP or OrangeFox installed on your device. You can find the custom recovery for your device on [TWRP website](https://twrp.me/Devices/Huawei/) or [OrangeFox website](https://orangefox.download/en/devices). To install a custom recovery, you need to flash it using fastboot commands.<br>
<br>To root your device, you can use Magisk or SuperSU. Magisk is preferred as it is more stable and has more features such as Magisk Hide, Magisk Modules, etc. You can download Magisk from [here](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases). To install Magisk, you need to flash the Magisk zip file using a custom recovery.<br> 8cf37b1e13
