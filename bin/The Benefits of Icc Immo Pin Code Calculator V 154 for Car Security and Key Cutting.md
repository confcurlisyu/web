## How does ICC Immo Code Calculator V 154 work?
 
ICC Immo Code Calculator V 154 works by using different methods to calculate the codes for different immobilizer systems. Some of the methods are:
 
- VIN method: This method uses the vehicle identification number (VIN) to calculate the PIN code or the mechanical key code. This method is fast and easy but not supported by all models.
- Serial number method: This method uses the serial number of the immobilizer or related electronic unit to calculate the PIN code or the access code. This method is more reliable but requires reading the serial number from the unit.
- Outcode method: This method uses an outcode generated by the immobilizer system to calculate the PIN code or the access code. This method requires connecting to the car via an OBD interface and entering the outcode into the software.
- Eeprom dump method: This method uses a dump file of the eeprom memory of the immobilizer system to calculate the PIN code or the access code. This method requires reading the eeprom data from the unit using a programmer device and saving it as a file.

Once ICC Immo Code Calculator V 154 calculates the codes, it can display them on the screen or print them out. It can also save them as a file for future use. ICC Immo Code Calculator V 154 can also perform other functions such as:
