Inventor Nastran 2019 is a software product that allows you to perform finite element analysis (FEA) on your 3D models. FEA is a numerical method that can simulate the behavior of structures and materials under various conditions, such as stress, strain, temperature, vibration, and more. With Inventor Nastran 2019, you can optimize your designs, validate your performance, and reduce errors and costs.
 
Inventor Nastran 2019 is integrated with Autodesk Inventor, a 3D CAD software that lets you create and edit 3D models. You can access Inventor Nastran 2019 from the Inventor environment, and use the same interface and commands. You can also import and export models from other CAD software, such as AutoCAD, SolidWorks, CATIA, and more.

## Example 1: Linear Static Analysis of a Bracket
 
In this example, we will analyze a simple bracket that is fixed at one end and has a load applied at the other end. We want to find out the stress and displacement distribution in the bracket.
 
The first step is to create or import the 3D model of the bracket in Inventor. Then, we can switch to the Inventor Nastran 2019 environment by clicking on the Nastran tab in the ribbon. We can see that the model is automatically meshed with finite elements, which are small pieces that represent the geometry and material properties of the model. We can adjust the mesh size and quality if needed.
 
The next step is to define the analysis type and properties. In this case, we choose Linear Static Analysis, which means that we assume that the material behaves linearly and does not deform permanently. We also assign a material to the model, such as steel or aluminum. We can choose from a library of predefined materials or create our own.
 
The third step is to apply the loads and boundary conditions to the model. These are the external forces and constraints that affect the behavior of the model. In this example, we apply a fixed support at one end of the bracket, which means that it cannot move or rotate in any direction. We also apply a force of 100 N at the other end of the bracket, which acts perpendicular to the surface.
 
The final step is to run the analysis and view the results. We can click on the Solve button in the ribbon and wait for a few seconds until the analysis is completed. We can then see various output options in the Results panel, such as stress, displacement, strain, reaction force, and more. We can select any of these options and see a color-coded map of the values on the model. We can also create charts, tables, reports, and animations of the results.
 
## Example 2: Modal Analysis of a Guitar String
 
In this example, we will analyze a guitar string that is stretched between two fixed points and has a mass attached at its center. We want to find out the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the string.
 
The first step is to create or import the 3D model of the string in Inventor. Then, we can switch to the Inventor Nastran 2019 environment by clicking on the Nastran tab in the ribbon. We can see that the model is automatically meshed with finite elements, which are small pieces that represent the geometry and material properties of the model. We can adjust the mesh size and quality if needed.
 
The next step is to define the analysis type and properties. In this case, we choose Modal Analysis, which means that we want to find out how the model vibrates when it is not subjected to any external forces. We also assign a material to the model, such as steel or nylon. We can choose from a library of predefined materials or create our own.
 
The third step is to apply the boundary conditions to the model. These are the constraints that affect the behavior of the model. In this example, we apply a fixed support at both ends of the string, which means that they cannot move or rotate in any direction. We also apply a mass of 10 g at  the center of the string, which acts as a point mass.
 
The final step is to run the analysis and view the results. We can click on the Solve button in the ribbon and wait for a few seconds until the analysis is completed. We can then see various output options in the Results panel, such as frequency, mode shape, effective mass ratio, participation factor, and more. We can select any of these options and see a color-coded map of the values on the model. We can also create charts, tables, reports, and animations of the results.
