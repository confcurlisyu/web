The book is divided into three parts: Part I introduces the nature of public life and public space, Part II explores the human dimensions of public space, and Part III discusses the process and future of making public space. The book covers a wide range of topics, such as the rights, needs and meanings of public space users, the evolution and diversity of public space forms and functions, the role of public space in urban identity and culture, the challenges and opportunities of public space design and management, and the implications of public space for urban sustainability and social justice.
 
The book is richly illustrated with photographs, diagrams and maps that show various examples of public spaces from different countries and contexts. The book also provides references, an index and a list of the authors' backgrounds and affiliations. The book is intended for students, researchers, practitioners and policy makers who are interested in understanding and improving public space as a vital component of urban life.
 
Public Space is a classic and influential work in the field of environment and behavior studies. It offers a comprehensive and interdisciplinary perspective on how to integrate public space and public life in urban settings. It is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn more about the theory and practice of public space.
  
The book is organized into 12 chapters, each focusing on a different aspect of public space. The first chapter defines public space and public life, and explains the rationale and scope of the book. The second chapter traces the historical evolution of public space from ancient times to the present, highlighting the changes and continuities in public space forms and functions. The third chapter introduces the three human dimensions of public space: users' essential needs, spatial rights and meanings. The fourth chapter presents a framework for analyzing and evaluating public space based on these dimensions.
 
The next eight chapters illustrate the application of the framework to various types of public spaces, using case studies from different countries and contexts. The case studies include Boston City Hall Plaza, Pershing Park, Lovejoy and Forecourt Fountains, Plaza of the Centre Georges Pompidou, Grand Street Waterfront Park, Tranehytten Adventure Playground, Grace Plaza, Boston Waterfront Park, Haymarket, Vietnam Veterans Memorial, Times Square, Gas Works Park, Woonerf Delft, Bryant Park, Barretto Street Neighborhood Park and others. Each case study describes the physical and social characteristics of the public space, its history and development, its strengths and weaknesses according to the human dimensions framework, and its implications for design and management.
 
The final chapter summarizes the main findings and lessons from the book, and discusses the future of public space in relation to urban trends and challenges. The authors emphasize the importance of public space for urban quality of life, social equity and environmental sustainability. They also suggest some directions for further research and action on public space issues.
