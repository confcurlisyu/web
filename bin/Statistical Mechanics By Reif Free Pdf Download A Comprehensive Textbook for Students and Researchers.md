Statistical Mechanics by Reif is a comprehensive and rigorous text that covers the basic concepts and methods of statistical and thermal physics. The book is divided into four parts:

1. Part I: Basic Probability Concepts and Statistical Methods. This part introduces the notions of probability, random variables, distributions, averages, fluctuations, and the central limit theorem. It also explains the methods of statistical inference, such as maximum likelihood, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and the chi-squared test.
2. Part II: Systems of Particles in Equilibrium. This part applies the statistical ideas to systems of particles in equilibrium, such as ideal gases, paramagnets, harmonic oscillators, and blackbody radiation. It also derives the general statements of thermodynamics from the statistical postulates, such as the entropy, the free energy, and the laws of thermodynamics.
3. Part III: More Complicated Equilibrium Situations. This part deals with more complex equilibrium situations, such as phase transitions, quantum gases, Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics, and superconductivity. It also discusses the concepts of ensembles, partition functions, and thermodynamic potentials.
4. Part IV: Nonequilibrium Situations. This part covers nonequilibrium situations, such as transport theory, diffusion, heat conduction, viscosity, electrical conductivity, and thermal noise. It also treats dilute gases at varying levels of sophistication, such as the Boltzmann equation, the Chapman-Enskog method, and the Grad method.

The book is suitable for advanced undergraduate or graduate students who have a background in calculus, linear algebra, classical mechanics, and quantum mechanics. It contains many examples, exercises, and problems to help students master the material and apply it to real-world situations. The book also provides several appendices that review some mathematical tools and physical concepts that are used throughout the text.
