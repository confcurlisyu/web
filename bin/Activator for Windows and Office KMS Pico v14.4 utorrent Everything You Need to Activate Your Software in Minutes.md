Previously, KMS (Key Management Service) keys were automatically assigned to Open agreements, which are volume licensing contracts for small and medium-sized organizations. However, this practice has been discontinued because MAK (Multiple Activation Key) keys are now the preferred method for activating Microsoft products. MAK keys allow each computer to activate directly with Microsoft's hosted activation service. KMS keys, on the other hand, require a local activation server within the organization's network. KMS keys can still be assigned to Open customers who meet the minimum KMS activation threshold for Windows Server, OS, and Office products. The minimum threshold varies depending on the product and edition. To request a KMS key assignment as an exception, please submit a Web Form request to VLSC (Volume Licensing Service Center) Support. VLSC is an online portal where customers can manage their volume licensing agreements and download licensed products.
