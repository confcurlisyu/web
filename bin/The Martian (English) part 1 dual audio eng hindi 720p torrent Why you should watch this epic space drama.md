The first part of The Martian begins with the Ares III mission landing on Mars and setting up their habitat. Watney is the botanist and engineer of the crew, and he is in charge of collecting soil samples. However, a sudden and violent dust storm forces the crew to abort the mission and evacuate. Watney is hit by a flying antenna and his suit's bio-monitor is damaged, making the crew think he is dead. They leave him behind and launch into orbit.
 
Watney survives the storm and makes his way back to the habitat. He realizes that he has no way of contacting Earth or his crew, and that he has limited supplies of food, water, and oxygen. He also knows that the next Ares mission will not arrive for another four years. He decides to "science the shit out of this" and find a way to stay alive and signal for help.
 
He starts by repairing his suit and the habitat's systems. He then uses his botany skills to create a makeshift farm inside the habitat, using Martian soil, human waste, and potatoes from the crew's Thanksgiving meal. He also manages to extract water from hydrazine fuel and oxygen from carbon dioxide. He keeps a video log of his activities and his thoughts, which provide some comic relief and insight into his personality.
 
Meanwhile, on Earth, NASA realizes that Watney is alive when they see his movements on satellite images. They try to figure out a way to communicate with him and rescue him. They also have to deal with the public reaction and the media attention. They decide to keep Watney's survival a secret from his crew, who are on their way back to Earth on the Hermes spacecraft.
 
Watney manages to locate an old Pathfinder probe that landed on Mars in 1997. He digs it out and brings it back to the habitat. He uses his engineering skills to modify it and establish a rudimentary communication system with NASA, using hexadecimal code and ASCII symbols. He is overjoyed to finally talk to someone after months of isolation.
 
NASA sends him instructions on how to upgrade his communication system using a camera and a laptop from the habitat. They also send him software updates for his rover and his suit, which allow him to travel farther and longer on Mars. They also inform him of their plan to send him a supply probe with more food and equipment.
 
Watney is thrilled by the news, but he also faces some challenges and dangers along the way. He has to deal with equipment failures, human errors, dust storms, explosions, and accidents that threaten his life and his mission. He also has to cope with the loneliness, boredom, stress, and fear of being stranded on an alien planet.
 
The first part of The Martian ends with a cliffhanger, as Watney prepares to leave the habitat and drive across Mars to reach the Ares IV landing site, where he hopes to rendezvous with the next crew. He has to cover over 3000 kilometers in 50 days, using only his rover, his trailer, and his ingenuity. Will he make it? Will NASA be able to rescue him? Will he ever see his crew again? You will have to watch the second part of the movie to find out.
