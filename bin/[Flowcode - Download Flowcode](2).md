Flowcode V5 Portable is a software application that allows you to create programs for PIC microcontrollers using a graphical interface. You can drag and drop icons that represent different functions, such as inputs, outputs, loops, variables, and calculations, and connect them with wires to create a flowchart. Flowcode V5 Portable then generates the corresponding code in assembly or C language, which you can compile and download to your microcontroller.

Flowcode V5 Portable is a free version of Flowcode V5 that has some limitations. It can only produce hex code for a few PIC microcontrollers, such as 16F628A, 16F690, 16F88, 16F84A, 16F877, 18F2220, 18F4431, Formula Flowcode, and ECIO[^2^]. It also has a limit of around 50 usable icons and a code size restriction for PIC microcontrollers[^2^]. However, it is still suitable for learning the basics of graphical programming and testing some hardware devices like the Formula Flowcode robot and ECIO[^2^].
 
Flowcode V5 Portable is easy to install and use. You can download it from the link below[^1^] and follow the installation instructions[^1^]. You will need a Windows operating system (32 or 64bit Windows 7, 8, 8.1 or 10), a processor of 1Ghz or faster, a RAM of 1Gb or more, and a HDD space of 1-4Gb (toolchain dependant)[^1^]. You will also need to install the appropriate toolchain for your PIC microcontroller[^1^] and the USB drivers for your hardware device[^1^].
 
Flowcode V5 Portable is a great way to start programming PIC microcontrollers with a graphical approach. You can create simple or complex programs without writing any code, and see the results on your microcontroller. You can also learn more about the underlying code by switching to the code view mode. Flowcode V5 Portable is a fun and educational tool for beginners and hobbyists who want to explore the world of microcontrollers.

## Flowcode V5 Portable: Some Examples of PIC Microcontroller Projects
 
Flowcode V5 Portable can be used to create various projects for PIC microcontrollers, ranging from simple to complex. Here are some examples of what you can do with Flowcode V5 Portable:
 
- **Thermometer:** You can use a temperature sensor, such as LM35, and an LCD display to measure and display the ambient temperature. You can also use a potentiometer to adjust the contrast of the LCD. You can find the Flowcode project file and the circuit diagram for this project here[^2^].
- **PWM:** You can use a PWM (pulse width modulation) output to control the brightness of an LED or the speed of a DC motor. You can also use a potentiometer to vary the duty cycle of the PWM signal. You can find the Flowcode project file and the circuit diagram for this project here[^2^].
- **Automatic Temperature Control:** You can use a PIC microcontroller to automatically control the temperature of an area, such as an incubator, HVAC, or greenhouse. You can use a temperature sensor, a fan, a heater, and some relays to regulate the temperature according to a set point. You can also use an LCD display to show the current and desired temperature. You can find the Flowcode project file and the video tutorial for this project here[^1^].
- **Direct Port Access:** You can use Flowcode V5 Portable to access the ports of your PIC microcontroller directly, without using any icons. This can give you more flexibility and control over your hardware. You can use direct port access to manipulate individual bits or bytes of a port, or to read or write data from external devices. You can find a video tutorial on how to use direct port access with Flowcode V5 Portable here[^3^].

These are just some of the examples of what you can do with Flowcode V5 Portable. There are many more projects that you can create with this software, depending on your imagination and creativity. Flowcode V5 Portable is a powerful and user-friendly tool for graphical programming of PIC microcontrollers.
